# Breast-Cancer-Classification-A-Machine-Learning-Approach-with-Feature-Extraction-and-SVM-
In this project, we develop an advanced machine learning model to enhance the accuracy of breast cancer diagnosis, our approach utilizes a set of sophisticated techniques using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to distinguish between benign and malignant breast tissue images.
